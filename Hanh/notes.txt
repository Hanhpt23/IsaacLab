Applying commands to the articulation involves two steps:
1. Setting the joint targets: This sets the desired joint position, velocity, or effort targets for the articulation.

2. Writing the data to the simulation: Based on the articulationâ€™s configuration, this step handles any actuation conversions and writes the converted values to the PhysX buffer.
